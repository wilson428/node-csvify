This is merely the csv and tsv parser packaged with [d3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3). I don't want to require d3 in its entirety since that (wonderful) library requires [jsdom](https://www.npmjs.org/package/jsdom), which requires a C++ compiler to support [contextify](https://www.npmjs.org/package/contextify). We don't need any of that stuff here.

Here is the original D3 license:
